# Mana-Ethereum Blockchain

An Elixir implementation of the Ethereum Blockchain.
This includes functionality to build and verify a chain of Ethereum blocks that may be advertised from any peer.
We complete the resultant state of the blocktree and form a canonical blockchain based on difficulty.

Mana-Ethereum's blocks are specified in a variety of sections throughout [the yellow paper](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper). Blocks, State and Transactions begin in section 4.

## Installation

Installation is handled through the bin/setup procedure in the [Mana-Ethereum README](../../README.md).
