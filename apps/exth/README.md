# Exth

Simple application for shared code that doesn't effectively belong in any other umbrella project. This includes common functions for encoding, debugging, etc.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `exth` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:exth, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/exth](https://hexdocs.pm/exth).
