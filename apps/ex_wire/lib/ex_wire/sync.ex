  This is the heart of our syncing logic. Once we've connected to a number
  of peers via `ExWire.PeerSupervisor`, we begin to ask for new blocks from those
  peers. As we receive blocks, we add them to our `ExWire.Struct.BlockQueue`.
  If the blocks are confirmed by enough peers, then we verify the block and
  add it to our block tree.

  Note: we do not currently store the block tree, and thus we need to build
        it from genesis each time.
